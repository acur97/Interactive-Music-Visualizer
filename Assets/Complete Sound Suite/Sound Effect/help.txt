Mobile friendly!

A collection of seven sound effects and filters which will allow you to take control of the sounds played in your game. 

Super simple setup, drag and drop the script into any gameobject which contains an audio source. All parameters and configurations can be changed in realtime.
You can stack as many effects as you want in the same object.
You can apply effects to many objects in the scene simultaneously.
Ultra fast algorithms, works fine in mobile devices.

Filter and Effects Description and Parameters

Equalizer
---------
Three band equalizer
Low freq: Set the gain of the low frequencies
Mid freq: Set the gain of the mid frequencies
High freq: Set the gain of the High frequencies

Reverb
------
Creates a reverb effect by repeating the input at certain intervals.
Delay seconds: The retard of the reverb feedback in seconds.
Decay: How loud the feedback sounds.
Stages: How many times the feedback will repeat.

Delay
-----
Creates a delay effect. You can use it to create morecomplex effects, for example, by varying the samples in real time you will get a phaser effect.
Samples in delay: The amount of samples to delay.
Delay blend: How much the delay is mixed with the original signal.
Delay volume: Final volume of the sound.
Feedback: Feedback volume.

Tremolo
-------
Creates a tremolo on the sound
Depth: Gain of the tremolo
Effect rate: Length of the tremolo effect in samples

Biquad
------
Cutoff frequency: Cut frequency for low pass filter
Resonance: Resonance frequency

High pass
------
Cutoff frequency: Lowest frequency allowed for filter
Resonance: Resonance frequency

Low pass
------
Cutoff frequency: Highest frequency allowed for filter
Resonance: Resonance frequency
